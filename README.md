RAT implementation instructions.
1) Move all files in your favourite path, let's say they will be located on "/home/ntnu/autoRATs".
2) Make a cronjob called every 15 minutes. This job should only call timestamp.sh in its path, like this "* * * * */15 /bin/bash /home/ntnu/autoRATs/DataCollectorPY/timestamp.sh".
3) The script will download a .csv for each RAT in timestamp.txt and will upload statistics on Firebase database as well.
Note:
- Remember to create and use your very own private keys for Firebase, the place it in DataCollector/PrivateKey/ folder raplacing the ones already there. The files are are uploaded just to give you an idea of the needed format.
