RAT implementation instructions.
1) Move all files in your favourite path.
2) Make a cronjob called every 15 minutes. This job should only call rat_downloader.sh in its path.
3) The script will download a .csv with RAT's answers.
Notes:
- The csv file will be named after the RAT number
- The RAT name will be the parmater passed to rat_downloader.sh (es: "RAT1")
- RAT-1.csv gives you an example of the expected result.
