A table entry for all packets not matching any other route in the forwarding table.,"As routing influence traffic flow which again influence delay, route instabilities/flapping may be the result.",A connected group of IP subnets run by one or more network operators which has a single clearly defined routing policy.,"As IGPs operate within a autonomous system (AS), the operator of the AS may chose an IGP to match required network size and ease of installation and configuration.","...IS-IS do not apply IP for communication with neighbours, and easily supports both IPv4 and IPv6."
